		<h1>Letter to Frege, 1902</h1>
		<p> Dear colleague,</p> 
		<p> For a year and a half I have been acquainted with your Grundgesetze der Arithmetik, but it is only now that I have been able to find the time for the thorough study I intended to make of your work. I find myself in complete agreement with you in all essentials, particularly when you reject any psychological element [Moment] in logic and when you place a high value upon an ideography [Begriffsschrift] for the founda­ tions of mathematics and of formal logic, which, incidentally, can hardly be dis­ tinguished. With regard to many particular questions, I find in your work discussions, distinctions, and definitions that one seeks in vain in the works of other logicians. Especially so far as function is concerned(§ 9 of your Begriffsschrift), I have been led on my own to views that are the same even in the details. There is just one point where I have encountered a difficulty. You state (p. 17 [p. 23 above]) that a function, too, can act as the indeterminate element. This I formerly believed, but now this view seems doubtful to me because of the following contradiction. Let w be the predicate: to be a predicate that cannot be predicated of itself. Can w be predicated of itself? From each answer its opposite follows. Therefore we must conclude that w is not a predicate. Likewise there is no class (as a totality) of those classes which, each taken as a totality, do not belong to themselves. From this I conclude that under certain circumstances a definable collection [Menge] does not form a totality.</p>

		<p>I am on the point of finishing a book on the principles of mathematics and in it I should like to discuss your work very thoroughly.1 I already have your books or shall buy them soon, but I would be very grateful to you if you could send me reprints of your articles in various periodicals. In case this should be impossible, however, I will obtain them from a library. </p>
		<p> The exact treatment of logic in fundamental questions, where symbols fail, has remained very much behind; in your works I find the best I know of our time, and therefore I have permitted myself to express my deep respect to you. It is very regrettable that you have not come to publish the second volume of your Grund­ gesetze ; I hope that this will still be done.</p>
	<p>
			Very respectfully yours,</p>
		<p>	BERTRAND RUSSELL</p>
